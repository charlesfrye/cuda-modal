# CUDA MODE

This repository contains some sample code that's helpful for getting started with using CUDA on Modal.

The subdirectories include:
- `cuda`: A demonstration of how to compile and run custom CUDA code on Modal.
- `cupy`: A simple script showing the use of CuPy on Modal.
- `jupyter_on_modal`: A script for running a Jupyter server on Modal, plus two example notebooks from the CUDA MODE class.
These notebooks show workflows for using CUDA from Python.

You can find a lot more examples of how to use Modal in the [examples repository](https://github.com/modal/modal-examples).
